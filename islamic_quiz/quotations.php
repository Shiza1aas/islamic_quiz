      "Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, Allaah will make a path to Paradise easy for him." (Al-Bukhaari)
    </span>

        These verses of the Qur'an and the hadith clearly showing the importance of Ilm that a Muslim must have.
         It's matter of pity that in spite of importance of Ilm in Islam, majority of muslims are in darkness. 
         It's time to wake up, to gain knowledge and to follow the correct path. 
         Alhamdulillah, the main intention for this site is to provide a platform where muslims can judge their ILM.
